### Service Coverage Policy

Service Coverage is intended to function as discretionary risk cover, and not as a contract of insurance. The products and services described herein are not provided by a third party regulated insurance company; valid claim payment is enforced by token-enabled economic incentives (and is expressly subject to token value volatility risk) and alternative dispute resolution but is not a guarantee of reimbursement, partial or complete, even in the event of a valid claim. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF SERVICE COVERAGE, YOU MUST ADHERE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVIDED, LINKED OR REFERENCED WITHIN THIS POLICY DOCUMENT AT ALL TIMES DURING THE COVERED TERM.
