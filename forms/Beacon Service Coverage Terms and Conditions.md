## Beacon Service Coverage Terms and Conditions

Beacon Service Coverage is intended to function as discretionary risk cover, and not as a contract of insurance. The products and services described herein are not provided by a third party regulated insurance company; valid claim payment is enforced by token-enabled economic incentives and alternative dispute resolution but is not a guarantee of reimbursement, partial or complete, even in the event of a valid claim. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF BEACON SERVICE COVERAGE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Each prospective claimant acknowledges that automated notifications may be sent to the email address(es) provided by such claimant, and ignoring, marking as spam, or unsubscribing from emails related to its subscribed Beacon(s) waives notice as to Beacon Service Coverage updates and may result in coverage lapse and subsequent loss of funds.

A valid submitted claim under Beacon Service Coverage (a “Claim”) by one having duly paid for a Beacon subscription and corresponding tier of service coverage via their public address on an applicable public blockchain (an applicable “Claimant”) must comply with the following:

- A Claim must demonstrate a direct nexus between Claimant’s lawful paid usage of the applicable Beacon, the material malfunction of such Beacon, and the alleged permanent damages or losses to the Claimant caused by such malfunction. No Claim may be altered after submission.

- Only Beacon material malfunctions are covered under Beacon Service Coverage, which includes (in each case, where relevant to the covered Beacon and claimed damages): address whitelisting failures, lack of Beacon updates (when a Beacon response was appropriately due according to the applicable deviation threshold), material malfunction in Airnode software, and material malfunction or exploit in the applicable Airnode or Beacon protocol smart contracts. 

   - Blockchain failure (including but not limited to a reorganization, fork, 51% or other consensus attack), API outage, misreporting by the data provider/API (regardless of whether accidental or intentional), blockchain provider outage or substantial malfunction, and Airnode user error by a data provider, and any Beacon material malfunction without substantial impact to the covered Beacon, are __not covered__ under Beacon Service Coverage.

- Claimant must initiate a Claim within 72 hours of the nexus of the Claim, else Beacon Service Coverage is waived. No Claim may include an event, nexus, transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences involved in a prior or separately pending Claim by the same Claimant, regardless of success.

- A Claim must specify and evidence direct quantifiable permanent damages to the Claimant from, or direct contractual privity with, the affected protocol, application, smart contract, service, product, or entity (the “Affected User”). Such damages must be reasonably exact and objectively calculated “make-whole” amounts at the time of the event giving rise to the Claim. No indirect, lost profit, consequential, or punitive damages are eligible under Beacon Service Coverage whatsoever, and are waived in their entirety by Claimant. 

- Claimant, Affected User, and all relevant usage of the applicable Beacon is, and was at the time of the nexus of the Claim, compliant with all applicable terms and conditions of (a) the data provider for such Beacon; and (b) the API3 Foundation (as set forth at https://api3.org/terms-and-conditions).  

- No contributory negligence or intentional conduct or omission by the Claimant or by the Affected User itself, with respect to the Affected User, existed that could reasonably have contributed to or affected the likelihood of the applicable Beacon material malfunction or any Claimed damages.

- No illegality existed in the Claimant’s or Affected User’s usage, or the usage of any controlling person of either of the foregoing, of the Beacon at issue (or that was so enabled by the Beacon) in an applicable jurisdiction to the Claimant, Affected User, or the data provider for such Beacon.

- Claimant agrees to Kleros, or such other reasonably neutral blockchain-based alternative dispute resolution protocol(s) or platform(s) specified by API3 Foundation from time to time as a qualifying forum, for exclusive dispute resolution and adjudication as to any Claim.

- Claimant will indemnify and hold API3 Foundation and its directors, founders, representatives, agents, employees, contractors, advisors, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Indemnitees”) harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, demands and investigations and all resulting costs, liabilities, damages and expenses, arising out of the Claim, any Resolution Offer (as defined below), and any breach by Claimant of these Beacon Service Coverage Terms and Conditions.

- Claimant waives any and all claims against or related to the Indemnitees and the relevant data provider applicable to the Beacon at issue, and waives any other claims or remedies (at law or in equity) of any type whatsoever for the same event, nexus, transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences under Claimant’s service coverage policy applicable to such Claim.

- Claim coverage amounts and award parameters are strictly limited to Claimant’s applicable subscription tier and any prescribed limits to Beacon Service Coverage at the time of Claimant’s subscription, as described in Claimant’s applicable Beacon Service Coverage policy.

- Claim payments may be made to Claimant or its identified designee in token value (including but not limited to in API3 tokens) reasonably equivalent to the US dollar amounts set forth in any Claim award decision or Resolution Offer, as solely calculated by API3 Foundation or its designees or by the applicable dispute resolution process.

- Following a validly initiated Claim pursuant to these Terms and Conditions, certain agents or designees of the API3 Foundation may offer a discretionary claim resolution offer to the Claimant (a “Resolution Offer”). If such a Resolution Offer is accepted by the Claimant, Claimant acknowledges and agrees their corresponding Claim may be deemed dismissed, resolved and satisfied in its entirety at API3 Foundation’s sole discretion upon completed payment of the amount (if any) described in the Resolution Offer, and the Claimant affirms its waiver of any and all claims or remedies of any type whatsoever arising from the same nexus, the Beacon at issue, and the data provider applicable to the Beacon at issue under Claimant’s service coverage policy applicable to such Claim.
