In consideration of the mutual benefits and obligations set forth in this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Party A and API3 agree as follows:

1.	**Services**. API3 hereby engages Party A to provide API3 or its written designee with the following services: _____________________ (including any other services reasonably related thereto and/or as mutually agreed in writing between the Parties, the “Services”). 

2.	**Term**.

The term of this Agreement (the "Term") commences on the Effective Date and remains in full force and effect (except for the terms of this Agreement which expressly survive the expiry or termination of this Agreement) until [DATE] /// [milestone completion ([as confirmed in writing by API3][as evidenced by ______]) of ____________] or until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

b.	This Agreement may be terminated in writing upon thirty (30) calendar days’ prior written notice by either Party, or otherwise by mutual agreement of the Parties. However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if Party A has been provided written notice from API3 as to any issue with the quality or provision of the Services which remains uncured for ten days in API3’s sole reasonable discretion, this Agreement may be terminated in writing upon ten calendar days’ prior by written notice from API3. 

c.	For avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with this section at any point in a calendar month or compensation cycle, and Party A’s compensation for such calendar month or compensation cycle shall be reduced or prorated accordingly to match the actual number of days providing Services for such calendar month or compensation cycle, as applicable.

4.	**Independent Contractor Relationship**. In providing the Services under this Agreement, the Parties expressly agree that Party A is acting as an independent contractor and not as an employee of API3 or any other related entity. Party A and API3 acknowledge and agree that this Agreement does not create a partnership of any kind, nor any joint venture or similar relationship, and is exclusively a contract for service. Party A acknowledges and agrees that Party A is solely responsible for paying and otherwise complying with all laws, regulations, and other governmental requirements applicable to Party A including but not limited to paying all taxes, expenses, and other amounts due from Party A of any kind related to compensation, payments or other transfers of value made to Party A under this Agreement.
