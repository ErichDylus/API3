## Voting Power Delegation Disclosure

*Last updated: July 27, 2021*

Please be advised:

I control the private key for the externally owned account 0xb7f49E02552751b249caE86959fD50D887708B1D (ENS: erichdylus.eth) (the “Delegated Address”).

I, via the Delegated Address, have staked a certain amount of API3 tokens in the API3 DAO governance contract (contract address: 0x6dd655f10d4b9E242aE186D9050B68F725c76d76) and I intend to participate in the governance of API3 DAO, whether by proposing, voting, abstaining, or engaging in related discourse or otherwise, in accordance with its applicable parameters and guidelines. I understand that other externally owned accounts and addresses may delegate their voting power to me from time to time and intend that this disclosure will generally govern my actions as a delegate.
Though I do not have a formal policy for delegation, in participating in the governance of API3 DAO, I intend to act on the following principles:

-	I will seek to remain informed about governance proposals and vote on matters from time to time using my independent judgment unless otherwise disclosed;

-	I will act in good faith and use reasonable care in participating in governance, including in making proposals and in voting;

-	I will endeavor to provide transparent, good faith, and honest information as to my motivations and reasoning in carrying out my role as a delegate, or when soliciting the delegation of voting power or votes;

-	I am not a party to any voting bloc, trust, or other group and will not engage in vote-buying, vote-selling, bribery, manipulation, or other undisclosed vote solicitation or coordination; and

-	To the extent I am aware of the existence or potential for a material non-public conflict of interest (whether for myself or a delegator) with respect to a proposal, I will refrain from voting in my capacity as a delegate or specifically for such delegator, as applicable, with respect to such proposal.

### Conflict Disclosure

I currently have economic interests in and contractual obligations with the API3 Foundation (the legal entity wrapper for the API3 DAO) as legal counsel, and I engage in the LexDAO and LeXpunK DAO communities and generally as an autonomous attorney from time to time. I may have direct or indirect economic interests in the various projects, entities, networks, and protocols related to the foregoing, and I also use and hold various other cryptocurrencies, tokens, stablecoins and other digital assets from time to time, including but not limited to $BTC, $ETH, $API3, $SUSHI, and certain yearn.finance vaults.

Except as disclosed herein, in participating in the governance of API3 DAO, I am not acting on behalf of the API3 Foundation, nor on behalf of any client, nor any voting power delegator, whether or not such delegation was solicited. If my views expressed in governance contexts are interpreted or used in a manner that leads to some injury or detriment, there will be no legal recourse against me as a vote delegate or otherwise, nor will there be any coverage or indemnity from any applicable insurance or similar mechanism.
### Disclaimer of Duty to Update

I assume no duty and provide no guarantee of keeping these disclosures up to date, nor of adjusting these disclosures for each applicable governance process, but will endeavor to act in good faith when soliciting the delegation of voting power and when acting in my capacity as a delegate.
You may contact me at edylus@protonmail.com, on Twitter or Telegram at @erichdylus, or on Discord at Erich#4621; however, please note I assume no duty for, and cannot guarantee my responsiveness to, or any action upon, any individual question, feedback, or request from a vote delegator or otherwise.
